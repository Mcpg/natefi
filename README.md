# NatEFI
This is my header library for C++17 trying to be [UEFI 2.8](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_8_final.pdf) compliant.

Can't guarantee *anything*. You're probably better off using any other header set. Also you need LLVM to build the example/test.
At the time of writing, NatEFI isn't finished, and doesn't contain enough definitions to do much. I'll extend it with time.

## License
This thing is just straight copying information from the UEFI specification, so you're free to do anything you want to do with the header file. Just don't take credit for creating it or something. And don't be evil:tm:
